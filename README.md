# SlimeVR Tracker Protocol
The UDP + flatbuffer protocol for SlimeVR trackers.

This protocol is an *input* to the [SlimeVR Server](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Server),
and should be used for reading data from SlimeVR trackers. The
[SolarXR](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SolarXR-Protocol) protocol is an *output* of the
server, and should be used for VR applications.
